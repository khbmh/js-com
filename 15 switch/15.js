/*

Explanation:
Expression: The value of the day variable is evaluated in the switch statement.

Cases: Each case represents a possible value of the day variable. When a case matches the value of day, the code inside that case block is executed.

Break: The break statement is used to exit the switch block. Without it, the code would "fall through" and execute all subsequent cases until a break is encountered or the end of the switch block is reached.

Default: The default case is optional. It runs if none of the specified cases match the value of the expression. Itâ€™s like the final else in an if-else chain.

This example will print "Wednesday" to the console because the value of day is 3, which matches the third case.
